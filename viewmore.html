                        After several months of learning in the Frontend <span>

                    <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to <span> spend hours and hours learning, 
                        then try to create <span> simple projects using what I learned or work new <span>techniques into existing projects.
                        <span class="learningProgress-span">
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share <span> what I was learning and most things about my journey <span> with the world.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How I got started</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal <span> site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                        After <span> each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only <span> reflect on what I learned 
                        but also write short summaries <span> of what I learned using my own words. <span class="learningProgress-span">
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized <span> that posting my learning summaries was also helping <span> others learn and stay motivated.
                    </p>
